Restaurant Online Payment Solution 
</h2>

## Objective
Objective was to build an online ordering solution for small restaurants looking to offer their customers a way to order and pay for their products online using the React based platform Gatsby.js as the static site generator and [Stripe] as the content management and payment processing system. The website is built as a dynamic site for changing content and is designed to query for content from the Stripe API via GraphQL. It is search engine optimized with on-page SEO with each page targeting specific keywords used for ranking on google search as well as responsive for a cohesive look across all device platforms from mobile to 4K monitors.

## Forking this repo
Please note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs].


## Installation and Setup
Before getting started on configuring the client side, please ensure you've set up your Stripe account properly and added products via the Stripe Dashboard in order to have products/items to fetch for testing. Reference the Gatsby [documentation] for a detailed tutorial on integrating Stripe with a Gatsby site.


1. Install the Gatsby CLI

```npm i gatsby-cli```

2. Install and use the correct version of Node using NVM

```nvm install```

3. Install dependencies

```npm install```

4. Start the development server

```gatsby develop```

## Building and running for production

1. Generate a full static build

```gatsby build```

2. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

```gatsby serve```

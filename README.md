## Objective
Objective was to build a blog using the React based platform Gatsby.js as the static site generator and [Contentful] as the content management system (CMS).

## Forking this repo
Some people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually yes, with attribution.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

Please also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs].

### TL;DR
Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [blog.davidvelez.io]. Thanks!
